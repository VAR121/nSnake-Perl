# nSnake-Perl
Snake Game clone written in Perl using Curses Library. Play and Enjoy.

For learners of Curses Library in perl, all the code has been extensively documented within the program.
Some users might encounter problems with rendering of unicode characters, this can be a issue because of lack unicode utf-8 wide character support.
It should be resolved by setting appropriate locale. or building Curses with wide character support.

I've uploaded screenshots to show how real working copy of nSnakes work.
